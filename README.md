# Rotatable Equipment

This is a Factorio mod that dynamically allows the player to rotate any non-square equipment by pressing the configured button (defaults to `R`). This mod should be compatible with most other mods.


## Mod Compatibility

The way that Factorio handles sprites means that I cannot modify the sprite images dynamically to fit with this mod in a clean manner. There are 3 ways this mod can handle the sprites of other mods; default, rotated sprite, rotated sprite filename

Rotated sprites from the vanilla game are rotated *90Â° clockwise*, this is the standard for this mod, but obviously I cannot stop you from doing the opposite.

This mod handles the new prototypes in the `data-updates` stage of initialization, so as long as any `data.raw` modifications are done in the main `data` stage they will be picked up by this mod without any need for dependencies.


### Default Sprite Compatibility

If new equipment are added with no additional action from the other mod then this is how the sprite is handled.

Any non-square equipment sprite will be trimmed to the largest square possible and be used like that.

Example: A 32x64 equipment (1x2 squares) will have the sprite trimmed to use the top 32x32 half of the image.


### Sprite Compatibility Override

If the equipment prototype in `data.raw` has a property called `rotated_sprite` then this property is assumed to be a *full* sprite definition. This definition will be used as is, so it must be a valid [Prototype/Sprite](https://wiki.factorio.com/Prototype/Sprite).

Example: The base game `battery-equipment` is normally 32x64, the `rotated-battery-equipment.png` is a 64x32 version of the base sprite. The following can be used in the main `data` stage to register it for rotation:

```lua
data.raw["battery-equipment"]["battery-mk2-equipment"].rotated_sprite = {
	filename = "__Rotatable_Equipment__/graphics/rotated-battery-mk2-equipment.png",
	height = 32,
	width = 64
}
```


### Sprite Filename Override

If the equipment prototype in `data.raw` has a property called `rotated_sprite_filename` and does *not* contain `rotated_sprite`, then `rotated_sprite_filename` will be used as the `filename` for the sprite. It is assumed to be the correct size for the new equipment.

Example: The base game `battery-equipment` is normally 32x64, the `rotated-battery-equipment.png` is a 64x32 version of the base sprite. The following can be used in the main `data` stage to register it for rotation:

```lua
data.raw["battery-equipment"]["battery-equipment"].rotated_sprite_filename = "__Rotatable_Equipment__/graphics/rotated-battery-equipment.png"
```
